# Introduction

The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) {{?RFC3748}} is a widely used standard that allows a server to authenticate a client using different authentication methods.
There is a huge variety of EAP methods available, that serve different purposes and have different security implications.

Two common EAP methods are EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS {{?RFC5281}}, that both use EAP-TLS {{!RFC5216}} to provide confidentiality of the inner authentication.
This inner authentication is most commonly password-based, meaning that an attacker that manages to compromise the TLS connection can eavesdrop on the authentication and observe the password.
The authentication of the server to the client within the TLS handshake thus is a vital security function of these EAP methods.

The operational praxis has shown that this is a common problem and security flaw.
The specification for EAP-TLS {{RFC5216}} does not include guidance on how to decide if a certificate is valid for this specific authentication.
This standardization gap has lead to user interfaces, where the default setting for certificate validation was set to "Do not validate".
Even if the validation is active, the supplicant has no implicit information to determine the expected subject name in the server's certificate, so users need to manually configure the expected domain.
Failure to configure this or not configuring it at all could again lead to an attacker being able to compromise the TLS connection and, as a result, also the password sent in the inner authentication.

There are two major security problems here, that this specification wants to address.
Firstly, the use of passwords as authentication method implies that the password needs to be sent to the server.
If an attacker observes this exchange, they can impersonate the user at any time.
Therefore, this specification uses FIDO authentication, which is based on asymmetric cryptography.
With this method, even if an attacker is able to compromise the TLS connection, they cannot impersonate the user based on the observed data.

The second major security problem is the specification gap regarding certificate validation.
With EAP-FIDO, the supplicants now have a clear specification on how to decide wether or not a server certificate is considered valid for the current authentication flow.
This is achieved by using the trust anchors available on most devices and a method to determine the valid server name based on implicit information of the authentication configuration.

# Overview over the EAP-FIDO protocol

The EAP-FIDO protocol comprises two phases: the TLS handshake phase and FIDO-exchange phase.

During the TLS handshake phase, TLS is used to authenticate the EAP-FIDO server to the client.

During the FIDO-exchange phase, the actual FIDO authentication is executed and the client authenticates itself to the server.

Once the FIDO exchange is completed successfully, the client and server can derive keying material from the TLS handshake phase implicitly.


## TLS handshake phase

During the TLS handshake phase, the client and server establish a TLS tunnel.
This is done using EAP-TLS {{RFC5216}}, {{!RFC9190}}, {{!RFC9427}} with the modifications described in TODO:SECTION LINK.
As part of the TLS handshake protocol, the EAP-FIDO server will send its certificate along with a chain of certificates leading to the certificate of a trusted CA.
The client will check this certificate using the rules in TODO:SECTION LINK.

Once the TLS tunnel is established, the client and server proceed to the FIDO-exchange phase to perform the authentication of the client.

## FIDO-exchange phase

In this phase, the TLS record layer is used to securily tunnel information between the EAP-FIDO client and EAP-FIDO server.

For the FIDO-exchange phase, the client has two options, depending on the configuration and the capability of the FIDO token.

If the FIDO token supports residential keys and EAP-FIDO is configured to use these for authentication, the client generates a challenge from the TLS keying material and triggers a FIDO challenge.

If the client is not configured to use residential keys, the client first needs to send its username to the server.
The server will answer with a list of FIDO key IDs and the client will attempt to use one of these keys to authenticate.

# EAP-FIDO protocol flow and message format

This section describes the preconditions and the configuration needed for EAP-FIDO, the protocol flow and the message format

## Preconditions and Configuration

In order to successfully perform an EAP-FIDO authentication, the server and the client have to meet some preconditions and need to have a configuration.

EAP-FIDO assumes that the FIOD authenticator is already registered with the server, that is, the EAP-FIDO server has access to the public key used to verify the authenticator's response as well as the corresponding credential id.

On the client side, the supplicant must be configured with the Relying Party ID (see {{openquestions_rpid}}, and, if Passkeys are not used, with a Username.

## TLS handshake phase

The packet format for EAP-FIDO messages follows the format specified in {{RFC5216, Section 3}} with the following modifications:

* The Type field is set to TODO [awaiting IANA early allocation] (EAP-FIDO)
* Within the Flags field, the Version bits are set to the major version of EAP-FIDO. For this specification, the version is 0. Future EAP-FIDO versions MAY increase the version number.

### EAP-FIDO Start packet

In the first packet from the server to the client, the S-bit of the Flags MUST be set, indicating the start of the EAP-FIDO protocol.
It MUST NOT be set in any subsequent packet.

[^RPID_Option1]{:jf}

[^RPID_Option1]: Depending on the decision on the way, the RPID is determined, some additional spec may be added here, see {{openquestions_rpid}}.

### Version negotiation

The version of EAP-FIDO is negotiated in the first exchange between server and client.
The server sets the highest major version number of EAP-FIDO that it supports in the V field of the flags in its Start message.
In the case of this specification, this is 0.
In its first EAP message in response, the client sets the V field to the highest major version number that it supports that is no higher than the version number offered by the server.
If the client version is not acceptable to the server, it sends an EAP-Failure to terminate the EAP session.
Otherwise, the version set by the client is the version of EAP-FIDO that MUST be used and both server and client MUST set the V field to that version number in all subsequent EAP messages.

Given the limited range of the V field (values 0-7), future EAP-FIDO versions MUST NOT increase the major version if there are no changes to the outer message format.
Minor version updates that only affect the inner protocol flow MUST be done with means available during the TLS handshake, i.e. using Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN).

### Fragmentation

Each EAP-FIDO message contains a single leg of a half-duplex conversation.
Since EAP carrier protocols may constrain the length of an EAP message, it may be neccessary to fragment an EAP-FIDO message across multiple EAP messages.

The fragmentation method is described in {{RFC5216, Section 2.1.5}}.

### TLS Handshake Requirements

The client and server perform a TLS handshake following the specification in {{RFC5216, Section 2}} and {{RFC9190, Section 2}} with the following modifications:

* TLS version 1.3 or higher MUST be negotiated.
* Mutual authentication is not required. Implementations MUST support EAP-FIDO without TLS client authentication, but MAY allow it, i.e. if EAP-FIDO is used as a 2-Factor authentication method where TLS client certificates are the first factor and the FIDO authentication is the second.
* The certificate of the server MUST be validated. The different options for validation are listed in {{tls_server_cert_verify}}.
* (FIXME, depending on RPID option) The client MUST send the desired Relying Party ID for the FIDO exchange in the Server Name Indication extension.

### TLS Server Certificate Verification
{: #tls_server_cert_verify}

(FIXME: Currently only bulletpoints, will be converted into text)
* Clients MUST support validating against a built-in list of Root CAs, ideally WebPKI.
* Implementations MAY support pinning a trust anchor
* The RPID MUST be validated against the certificate name (How exactly is still TODO)
* TODO: OCSP Stapling? Mandatory or not?

## FIDO-exchange

After the TLS handshake is completed, the client and server perform the FIDO-exchange to authenticate the client inside the TLS tunnel.

The server sends an authentication request to the client.
The client then decides if it has sufficient information to perform the FIDO authentication.
If this is case, the client responds with an authenication response which includes the FIDO response.
If the client needs additional information, i.e. because it does not use Passkeys and therefore needs a list of Key Identifiers, the client sends an information request to the server, which may include additional information from client to help the server to fulfil the information request, i.e. the inner username.
If the server receives such an information request it responds with the additional information.
The client answers then with an authentication response.

Depending on the result of the FIDO authentication, the server MAY choose to trigger a second FIDO authentication with a new authentication request packet.


* Server sends initial data
  * RPID?
  * Auth request level (Silent, up, uv)
  * Additional Client-Data
* Choice: Passkey or not?
  * When Passkey: GOTO "Client sends response"
* Client sends Username
* Server sends Key-List
* Client sends response
* Choice: Result
  * When Successful and sufficient:
    * Protected Success Indicator
  * When Successful and not sufficient:
    * Server sends signature request again with more information
  * When not Successful:
    * Protected Failure Indicator

### Message format

All EAP-FIDO messages in the inner authentication consist of a CBOR sequence with two elements:

type:
: integer to indicate the message type. {{msgtypes}} contains a list of the different message types.

attributes:
: a CBOR encoded map with attributes. A list of the different attributes, their assigned mapkey and the type are listed in {{mapkeys}}.

| Type | Description | Sent by |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 0    | Success indicator | Both |
| 1    | Authentication Request | Server |
| 2    | Authentication Response | Client |
| 3    | Information Request | Client |
| 4    | Information Response | Server |
{: #msgtypes title="Message types"}

| Mapkey | Type | Label | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | UTF-8 String | Identity | User Identity (usually username) |
| 1 | UTF-8 String | Relying Party ID | See {{openquestions_rpid}} |

### Potocol Sequence

# Implementation Guidelines

# Design decisions

This section documents several design decisions for the EAP-FIDO protocol

## Registration of FIDO2 keys is out of scope

The FIDO CTAP2 protocol has distinct primitives for the registration and the usage of a FIDO2 credential.
This specification requires that the registratrion of the security token has been done out-of-band, for example using the WebAuthn protocol in a browser context.

There are multiple degrees of freedom when registering a token with CTAP2.
This specification recognises the following choices at registration time, and defines how to effectuate an authentication transaction for any combination of these choices.

### Discoverable credentials vs. Non-Discoverable credentials

FIDO2 tokens contain a master key which never leaves the security perimeter of the token exists on the device.
FIDO2 tokens transact by generating asymetric keypairs which are bound to a scope (often: a domain name, a RADIUS realm).
The scoped keying material is saved in either of two locations:

- Non-Discoverable Credentials: All the keying material is stored on the server-side. The private key is encrypted with the token-specific master key so that the server can store, but not use, the device's private key. During authentication transactions, the keying material is sent to the token for local decryption and usage. The security token itself does not store any data persistently; it is stateless and thus the number of keypairs and scopes it manages is infinite.

- Discoverable Credentials: The keying material is stored on the security token itself, along with the scope for which the keypair was generated. During authentication transactions, only the scope (as configured, or as sent by the server) determines which keypair is to be used in the transaction. The key can store multiple keys for the same scope. The number of keypairs that can be stored on the key is finite.

EAP-FIDO supports both Discoverable and Non-Discoverable credentials.

### User involvement during registration

Token registration can involve one of two levels of asserting the user presence.

- UP (userPresence): the registration ceremony ensures that a person is present at the token while registering the device (e.g. human tissue needs to touch a physical security key while the registration transaction executes).
- UV (userVerification): the security token registers a unique property of the user during the registration ceremony, such that it is asserted that only the exact same person can interact with the token in the future (e.g. by registering a fingerprint or facial recognition)

During authentication transactions, an EAP-FIDO server can request one of three levels of asserting user presence.

- Silent (interaction with a human is not required)
- UP (physical interaction with a person is required)
- UV (physical interaction with the registered user is required).

An authentication transaction can not request a higher level than was set at registration time; i.e. a token registered in UP mode can not transact in UV mode.

EAP-FIDO supports all three transaction modes, and the server can signal its required minimum assertion level for each individual authentication transaction.

## FIDO2 key scopes

The scope of a FIDO2 key as set during the registration transaction determines the contexts in which it can be used.
In EAP-FIDO, the following three notions interplay:

- the realm of username as used in the EAP-Identity exchange ("outer ID")
- the servername as presented during the EAP-TLS exchange by the EAP-FIDO server
- the relyingPartyIdentifier (rpId) that is used during the FIDO CTAP2 client authentication phase

EAP-FIDO requires the registered scope to be:

- identical to the realm in the outer ID
- within the same second-level domain as the EAP-TLS server certificate will be
- within the same second-level domain as the FIDO rpId

## EAP-Method with EAP-TLS vs standalone EAP method to be used in tunnels

Since there already exist EAP methods that provide a TLS tunnel and are capable of encapsulating further EAP methods, e.g. EAP-PEAP or EAP-TTLS, the question arises, why this specification does not focus solely on the FIDO exchange as a standalone EAP method instead of re-specifying a new EAP-method that again makes use of EAP-TLS.

The main reason for a decision against this is the potential for misconfiguration.
One of the goals for this EAP method is to provide a means to validate the server certificate using implicit configuration options.
Using EAP-TTLS or EAP-PEAP would counteract this goal, since in most supplicants the configuration for the different phases of the tunneled TLS methods is done seperately, so the users would have to configure the certificate check parameters manually again.
Additionally, not every supplicant application allows access to information about the phase 1 exchange, namely the server certificate parameters, which is neccessary for the security of the EAP-FIDO exchange.
Specifying EAP-FIDO as standalone EAP methods would therefore require modifying the EAP-TTLS or EAP-PEAP stack.
Implementers might be tempted to re-use the insecure and error-prone configuration interfaces.
To prevent this from the start, EAP-FIDO specifies an EAP-TLS based EAP method that cannot be used standalone.

Although this requires protentially duplicate code for supplicants that support multiple EAP-TLS based methods, the authors believe this means of specification to be more resistant against implementation errors and prevent error-prone user interfaces.

# Open Questions regarding Protocol design

Note to RFC Editor: Remove this section before publication.

Since this specification is an early draft, there are a lot of open questions that we want to get community feedback on.

## How to determine the FIDO Relying Party ID?
{: #openquestions_rpid}

FIDO needs a relying party ID to function.
The question is how this RPID is determined, there are several options that all have pros and cons.

### Option 1: Configuration
The first option would be to just have the RPID as a configuration item, maybe with a default on the realm of the outer username.
Adding a configuration option complicates the setup of the EAP method, but hopefully not too much.
A misconfiguration of the RPID is also not that critical from a security standpoint.
The effects of a misconfigured RPID are only a problem if the used FIDO key is also registered with a third party, in which case the third party could trick the client to connect to a bogous network.

If the RPID deviates from the realm, the client could send the requested RPID using Server Name Indication.

### Option 2: Mandate RPID to equal Realm of the Username

The second option would be to mandate that the RPID is equal to the realm portion of the username.
This restricts options on how to use EAP-FIDO and may cause unnecessary difficulties in routing, if the convinient routing domain (e.g. the registered domain for a company) should not be used as RPID due to security concerns, or different RPIDs should be used under the same routing realm.

### Option 3: RPID is determined by the server and sent before the TLS handshake

Since the RPID plays an important role in the decision whether or not the certificate sent by the server is to be trusted, the RPID should be determined before the TLS handshake.
The server could determine the RPID based on the outer username and send it as payload in the EAP-TLS Start packet.
This way, the client has a clear indication as to whether or not to trust the server certificate sent in the subsequent TLS handshake.

However, this opens up some security issues that are yet to be investigated, since the RPID could be modified by an on-path attacker.

### Option 4: RPID is determined by the server and sent after the TLS handshake

WIth this option, the problem is that the client needs to cache the server certificate in order to determine if the RPID is valid. for the given certificate, unless the rules for certificate verification and RPID determination specify it otherwise.
One possibility to circumvent this would be to allow the server certificate names and the RPID to deviate, but validate both against the realm of the outer username, e.g. a realm of example.com with a server certificate for radius.example.com and the FIDO RPID fido.example.com.

This, however, adds a whole lot more of security concerns, especially in environments with different independent devisions under the same domain suffix.
